# Full Stack Developer Challenge

#### This is an interview challenge for full-stack developer role at Inkoniq IT Solutions. Please feel free to fork. Pull Requests will be ignored.



###### Requirements
Design a web application that allows users to play a trivia game. There should be one question with four options. Only one answer will be right. Clicking on the right answer takes to to next question. Clicking on any wrong answer ends the game for the user, but prompts for their name and saves the score in database.

Partial solutions are acceptable. It is not necessary to submit a complete solution that implements every requirement.



###### Admin view
Add/remove/update/view questions and answers
Delete/view names and scores
Assign user a userid and and make them admin(Auth implementation via passport with gmail login).



###### Employee view
List of names and scores
Play game



###### Challenge Scope
High level description of design and technologies used
Server side API (using a programming language and/or framework of your choice)
Implementation of at least 3 API calls
We will prefer if you use Node.js with MySQL for the database, but feel free to use other tech if you prefer.



###### Web app
Implementation of 2-5 web pages using a modern web framework (preferably React) that talks to server side
This should integrate with your API, but it's fine to use static responses for some of it
Document all assumptions made

Complete solutions aren't required, but what you do submit needs to run.
